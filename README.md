Description

Downloading Data
Fistly, I check to see if the zip file is in my computer and if not then I download it from the web. 
After downloading, I unzip the Data and load the pertinent packages.

File Preparation
Secondly, I load all the concerning files. 

For task 1, I used rbind() in order to merge training data and test data, and set the column titles.
Then I used cbind() to connect subject data and acitivity data, and combine it with the training and test data.

For task 2, I searched data that has "mean" or "std" in their title and connect them with the subject data.

For task 3, i merged the data and apply numbers to character names.

For task 4, I changed the names.

and for task 5, I output the data.
